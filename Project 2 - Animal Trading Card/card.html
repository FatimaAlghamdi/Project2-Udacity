			<p class="Brief-Description">
				Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth, and jaws
				for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold. Adult males
				have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black
				and also vary in length. The length and color of the mane is believed to be
				determined by such factors as age, genetics and hormones. Young lions have
				light spotting on their coats that will disappear as they grow up. Without
				their coats, lion and tiger bodies are so similar that only experts can tell them apart.
